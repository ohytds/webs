  <p>
    <strong>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language <u>developed</u> by Netscape was first used in Netscape browsers.</strong>
     However, Netscape was working with European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) to deliver a standardized, international programming l
     anguage based on core JavaScript. ECMA is an international standards association for information and communication systems.
     This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard.
      Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript.
      The first version of the ECMA standard was documented in the ECMA-262 specification. The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO
       (International Organization for Standardization) as ISO-16262.

    JavaScript 1.3 resolved the inconsistencies that JavaScript 1.2 had with ECMA-262,
    hile keeping all the additional features of JavaScript 1.2 except == and !=, which were changed to conform with ECMA-262.
    These additional features, including some new features of JavaScript 1.3 that are not part of ECMA, are under consideration
     for the second version of the ECMA specification.
For example, JavaScript 1.2 and 1.3 support regular expressions, which are not included in ECMA-262.
The second version of the ECMA specification had not been finalized when JavaScript 1.3 was released.
